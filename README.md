# Work Schedular!

## Description

My motivation for this project was to help users plan and see when events are going to be taking place. I built this to show my confidence with using time and applying time in for loops to possible employers while also helping users at the same time. This will help people organize and stay organized when using this website. I learned the how easy for loops can really change the feel of a html.
